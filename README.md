# Arcade-Game
This game requires three Javascript files to run simulatenously. (1) app.js contains primary object-oriented game play functionality, including character details and interactions. (2) engine.js contains the game loop functionality and creates the canvas. (3) resources.js is an image loading tool which caches images for repeated use. The game relies on five images: 2 characters (char-boy and enemy-bug) and 3 ground blocks (grass, stone, and water). There is also an HTML file with a "score" and "lives" div, and dialog box for end of game. Finally the CSS file simply centers the gameboad on the screen.
